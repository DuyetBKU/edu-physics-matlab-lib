## ✨ About This Project

Have you ever wondered how objects move, how forces interact, or how beautiful the laws of nature can be when visualized?

`physics-matlab-lib` is a passion project — a growing collection of **MATLAB codes** crafted to **simulate**, **visualize**, and **solve** core problems in **classical mechanics**. From simple harmonic motion to complex object trajectories, this library aims to make physics come alive through clean and educational code.

> 💡 "Physics is the poetry of the universe. And code is how we tell that story."
